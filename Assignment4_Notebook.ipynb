These flows are difficult to distinguish from legitimate flows, because in this case a host actually answered the initial SYN. \n",

    "- The destination is alive, but the port to which the SYN is sent is closed. If a client connects to a server's non-listening port, the server will send back a RST/ACK packet. According to normal TCP implementation guidelines, the scanner will immediately stop any TCP connection attempts once it receives a RST. Like in the previous case, the NetFlow record will show SYN requests from the scanner host to the destination host but no SYN/ACK packets in response."
